Advent of Code 2024 in Fortran

## 1: Historian Hysteria
Sum the absolute differences between two lists.
Then identify how many times is item from list-1 present in list-2.

## 2: red-Nosed Reports
Verify that numbers at a single line are all incresasing or decreasing
and that the differences are within a specified limits. Part 2 requires
to verify if the conditions are met if one of the numbers is removed.
Easy solution, using brute-force for Part 2.

## 3: Mull It Over
Parsing exercise - find "mul(a,b)" and "do()" and "don't()" instruction.
Clumsy algorithm using "state-machine", a more general solution to
parsing could be made (if time permits)...

## 4: Ceres Search
On a 2D character map, count how many times a word "XMAS" can be found.
The loop over neighbours of a particular position on the map.
